	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a programming term that quantifies the amount of 
		time it takes a sequence of code or an algorithm to process or 
		execute in proportion to the size and cost of input. It will 
		not look at an algorithm's overall execution time. It is efficient for quicker results.
	</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> refers to the total amount of memory space used
		by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for
		execution. Calculate the space occupied by variables in an 
		algorithm/program to determine space complexity. However, people 
		frequently confuse Space-complexity with auxiliary space. The time 
		complexity is commonly expressed using big O notation,
		typically O(n), O(n log n), O(2^(n)), etc., where n is the size in 
		units of bits needed to represent the input.</p>
